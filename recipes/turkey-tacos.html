        <p>This is recipe I tried for the first time a couple of weeks ago. It's fast, healthy, and it's using up the rest of the red cabbage from the <a href="../recipes/chicken-bowl.html">Sweetgreen Hot Honey Chicken Plate</a>.</p>
        <p>This is what the creator of the recipe had to say: Delicious and flavorful Pineapple Turkey Tacos, ready in 20 minutes for an easy weeknight meal. Add your favorite toppings, make into a taco salad if you wish! Gluten free and paleo friendly.</p>
