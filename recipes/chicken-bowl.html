        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is a new recipe I'm trying out this week. I chose it because I have some chicken thighs in the freezer and it has lots of fresh vegetables. Although I have never been to Sweetgreen, so I won't be able to testify if this meal does it's muse justice, I have heard good thing and am exited to give it a try.</p>
            <p>This is what the recipe author had to say about it: Ever since I went to New York earlier this summer and had Sweetgreen for the first time in years, I’ve been obsessed with recreating their bowls! This Sweetgreen Hot Honey Chicken Plate was a request after I made my favorite Salmon Taco Bowl recreation from Sweetgreen. The hot honey sauce in this dish is INCREDIBLE – it’s sweet, spicy, and this recipe makes enough to have leftovers. I topped it on a simple piece of roast salmon, and it was also so delicious.</p>
